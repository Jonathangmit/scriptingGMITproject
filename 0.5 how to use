## This is the how to use read me file
The committed work to this GIT repository has been assembled solely by myself Jonathan Harper

This how to use file explains the files within the repository.

## README.md file – 
This file contains the written document that supports and presents findings from analysis of the Iris data set
analysis.py – the central file which contains the executable script.
When executed the script will produce

##output.txt – 
This is an instantaneously produced readable text file containing data relevant to the write up . A second output file
19.analysis output report is in the git hub repository, this was the file used to complete the written report in the read me file.

It will will produce Plots (8 of, 4 x histogram, 1 x scatter, 3 x box) to support the analysis in the read me file.
Also within the repository are a text file this is the output file produced by analysis.py and these results used to produce the report in the Readme

Also within the repository are plots that have been edited to provide a better image than the original script will. These are

1.Petal Length.png
2.Petal Width.png
3.Sepal Length.png
4.Sepal Width.png
5.scatterplot.png
6.Iris setosa boxplot.png
7.Iris Versicolour box plot.png
8.Iris Virginica boxplot.png

In addition there are 2 files used to calculate configurable parameters for the SVC algorithm used in analysis.py. These are

## SVC investigation script.py

When executed produces 3 graphical outputs for the accuracy value of the SVC model using a different number for the training samples.  
It will also produce 2 csv files (datafile.csv & datafile2.csv). 
The CSV files are used to write to and extract data from to produce the graphical output.
Also within the repository are plots of this output that have been edited to provide a better image than the original script. 
These are
9.Investigation of SVC sample requirements (mean).png
10. Investigation of SVC sample requirements (standard deviation).png
11. Investigation of SVC sample requirements (variance).png

## SVC investigation script2.py

When executed produces 3 graphical outputs for the accuracy value of the SVC model using a different number for C. 
It will also produce 2 csv files (datafileC.csv & datafileC2.csv). 
The CSV files are used to write to and extract data from to produce the graphical output.
Also within the repository are plots of this output that have been edited to provide a better image than the original script. 
These are
12.Investigation of SVC C value (mean)
13. Investigation of SVC C value (standard deviation)
14. Investigation of SVC C value (variance)
Examples of the csv file outputs are also given
15. datafilehis.csv
16. datafile2his.csv
17. datafileChis.csv
18  datafileC2his.csv

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All other files in the repository represent development of the final analysis.py script e.g anaysisconstruct and its iterations and 
testing and its iterations. Other graphs included in the repository are graphs constructed to view different bin sizes and 
with and without the kde curve for data clarity and aesthetic purposes.

Hope you enjoy

Kind regards
