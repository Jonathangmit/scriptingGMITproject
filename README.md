# Project plan
* Other coursework (including computer arcitecture to be completed also + moodle exam)
Wks 1-2 (18/03/20 - 01/04/20) reseaching and selecting the data set.  Working on the set to produce workable data for manipulation.*
Week 3- 4 (02/04/20 - 15/04/20) 'Playing with the data' understanding how to produce outputs to other docs *
Week 5 (16/04/20 - 22/04/20) Complete analysis.py
Week 6 (22/04/20 - 29/04/20) Additional extra's if permittted.

# Definitions
SEPAL is the single unit of the  protective layer around the bud of the flower which they collectively form the layer known as the calyx. They are typically green in colour. The primary function as stated is to protect the flower ,although it can in many cases also offer support to the budded flower. In additon the SEPAL can form a defence for the budded flowers seeds although many will simply wither or become non functioning to the plant.

PETALS are like sepals modified leaves they are the single unit of what is collectivly known as the Corolla, trypically more attractive and brightly coloured in order to attract pollinators to the reproductive area of the plant. 

IRIS FLOWER DATA SET was intoruduced by British Biologist Ronald Fisher, although the actual data was collected by Edgar Anderson (American). The data set consistes of 50 samples of 3 Iris types Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. Wach was measured for petal length and width and sepal length and width. The data set setected for use in the following analysis was obtained from UCI and is accessed as a csv file for this exercise.

#Programming Diary
01/04/20 Got data from CSV file into python and produced it with correct column headings for the variables. Also produced separate histograms with KDE plots.
Next steps is to produce variable summary.
